Based on my analysis of the Cline codebase, besides `standalonePostMessage`, there are several other global objects and functions that need to be injected into the `window` object for the webview to function correctly in standalone mode:

## 1. `window.__is_standalone__`

This is a boolean flag that indicates whether the webview is running in standalone mode (outside of VS Code). It's used throughout the codebase to conditionally execute different code paths for standalone vs. VS Code environments. vscode.ts:14-18 vscode.ts:42 ChatView.tsx:42 grpc-client-base.ts:115-117

## 2. `window.WEBVIEW_PROVIDER_TYPE`

This property specifies the type of webview provider (either "sidebar" or "tab"), which determines how the webview behaves and renders certain UI components.WebviewProvider.ts:194-195 WebviewProvider.ts:300-301 ExtensionStateContext.tsx:110-111

## 3. `window.clineClientId`

This is a unique identifier (UUID) for each webview instance, used to establish client-specific communication channels between the extension backend and the webview UI. WebviewProvider.ts:197-198 WebviewProvider.ts:303-304
## Notes

These window injections are essential for standalone mode functionality as they:

- Enable the webview to detect it's running outside of VS Code (`__is_standalone__`)
- Allow proper message encoding/decoding for gRPC communication in standalone mode
- Provide the webview with its provider type context for correct UI rendering
- Establish unique client identification for multi-instance communication

The injections occur in both the regular HTML content generation (`getHtmlContent`) and the HMR (Hot Module Replacement) development version (`getHMRHtmlContent`) to ensure consistent behavior across development and production environments.
